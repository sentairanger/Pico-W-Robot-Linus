# Pico-W-Robot-Linus
Controlling a Pico W Robot using Micro Python, HTML, CSS and JQuery

## Getting Started

First make sure to download Micropython for the Pico W and make sure it is the correct UF2 file. Then upload this code to the Pico by saving it on the Pico using Thonny. Then run the code. To run it headlessly rename the code to `main.py`. The `robot-pwm` folder has the complete application which includes the servo motors and PWM control.
